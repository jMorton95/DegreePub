Define an input function that takes a string to prompt a user (for reusability).
    Prompt the user to input a number infinitely until an integer input is provided.
    Return the valid integer.

Define a function that takes in three number args, adds arg2 to arg1 if arg2 is greater than arg3. Return the sum & outcome.
    The first two are our number inputs.
    The third is our threshold number for addition (5)
    Return a tuple, 2 items in length, the first being the value and the second being a true/false


Initialise two variables as the return value of our input function.

Initialise two variables to destructure the return value of our conditional function, to the the value and whether or not the condition was met.

Output the results
